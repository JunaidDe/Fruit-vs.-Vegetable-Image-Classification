# Fruit-vs.-Vegetable-Image-Classification
This project is a deep learning-based image classification model that distinguishes between fruits and vegetables. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for accurate classification.
**Features**

Uses ImageDataGenerator for data augmentation and preprocessing.

Implements a CNN with Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, and Dense layers.

Trained on an image dataset stored in Google Drive.

Evaluates accuracy and loss metrics.

**Requirements**

Python 3.x

TensorFlow

Keras

NumPy

Matplotlib

Google Colab (for training on Google Drive dataset)

Installation

**Clone this repository:**

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/fruit-vs-vegetable.git

**Install dependencies:**

pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib

Ensure dataset is available in the correct path.

**Usage**

Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the model:

python train_model.py

**Results**

The model achieves high accuracy in classifying fruits and vegetables based on image inputs.
